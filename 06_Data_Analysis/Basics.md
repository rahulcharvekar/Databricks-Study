## ✅ Stage 6: Data Analysis with SQL & BI (Deep Dive)

---

### 🔹 1. Databricks SQL: Overview

**Databricks SQL** is a fully managed **data warehouse solution** built on the **Delta Lake** architecture.

#### 💡 Who uses it?

* **Data Analysts**: Writing SQL queries, building reports
* **Data Engineers**: Creating views and aggregates
* **BI Teams**: Connecting Power BI, Tableau, etc.

#### 🧱 Components:

| Component         | Purpose                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **SQL Warehouse** | Compute engine for running SQL queries |
| **Query Editor**  | Browser-based SQL editor               |
| **Dashboards**    | Visualize query results                |
| **Alerts**        | Notify users on query result changes   |

---

### 🔹 2. SQL Warehouses

Databricks SQL uses **SQL Warehouses** (formerly SQL Endpoints) to execute queries.

#### 🛠️ Setup Steps:

1. Go to **SQL** tab → "SQL Warehouses"
2. Click **Create** → Choose size (Small/Medium/Large)
3. Start the warehouse (autoscaling optional)

> You can have multiple warehouses for different teams, loads, or SLAs.

### 🔹 3. Writing Queries in Databricks SQL

#### 🧪 Sample Queries:

```sql
-- Basic SELECT
SELECT * FROM sales_data LIMIT 10;

-- Aggregations
SELECT region, SUM(revenue) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;

-- Join
SELECT a.id, a.name, b.total_spent
FROM customers a
JOIN transactions b ON a.id = b.customer_id;

-- Time-based filter
SELECT *
FROM events
WHERE event_date >= CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAYS;
```

---

#### 🧰 Features:

* SQL snippets & history
* Visual explain plan
* Syntax highlighting & autocomplete
* Parameterized queries (e.g., for dashboards)

---

### 🔹 4. Dashboards

You can create **interactive dashboards** directly in Databricks.

#### 📊 Dashboard Features:

* Add SQL query result as a widget (bar chart, pie, etc.)
* Filters (e.g., select region, date)
* Refresh schedule
* Share with others (view or edit permissions)

#### 📘 Example Use Cases:

* Sales trends by product or region
* Real-time user activity dashboards
* Top 10 performing campaigns

---

### 🔹 5. BI Tool Integration

Databricks easily integrates with common BI tools via **JDBC/ODBC**.

#### ⚙️ Popular Tools & Setup:

| Tool         | Method                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Power BI** | Use the **Databricks connector** or ODBC |
| **Tableau**  | Connect via Databricks connector         |
| **Looker**   | JDBC + SQL Warehouses                    |
| **Excel**    | ODBC or Power Query                      |

> You’ll need your **workspace URL**, **SQL warehouse token**, and **driver**.

#### Example Power BI Setup:

1. Open Power BI → Get Data → Databricks
2. Paste the workspace URL (`https://<workspace-url>`)
3. Enter access token and choose SQL warehouse

### 🔹 6. SQL Best Practices in Databricks

| Best Practice                        | Why It Helps            |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Use **Delta Tables**                 | Fast, reliable querying |
| Leverage **caching**                 | Improves performance    |
| Use **Z-Ordering** on filter columns | Boosts query speed      |
| Use **views** for repeated logic     | Simplifies dashboards   |
| Monitor **warehouse usage**          | Avoid unnecessary cost  |

---

### 📘 Real-World Analogy:

> Think of Databricks SQL as your **Google Sheets + Data Warehouse**. You write queries (like formulas), create dashboards (charts), and share reports — all in a cloud-native, scalable environment.

---

### ✅ Summary Checklist for Stage 6:

* [ ] Launch a SQL Warehouse
* [ ] Write and run basic SQL queries on Delta tables
* [ ] Create interactive dashboards
* [ ] Connect to external BI tools (Power BI, Tableau)
* [ ] Apply best practices for performance and cost
