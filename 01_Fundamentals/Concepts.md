## ✅ Stage 1: Fundamentals (Detailed Breakdown)

### 🔹 1. What is Databricks?

#### 💡 **Definition**:

Databricks is a **cloud-based data platform** built on top of **Apache Spark**, designed to simplify big data processing, machine learning, and collaborative data science.

#### 🔧 **Key Features**:

* Unified platform for data engineering, data science, analytics, and ML
* Supports Python, SQL, R, Scala
* Built-in support for **Delta Lake** (ACID-compliant data storage layer)
* Auto-scaling and optimized cluster management
* Seamless integrations with AWS, Azure, and GCP

#### 🧠 **Use Cases**:

* ETL pipelines and batch processing
* Streaming data analysis
* Data warehousing and BI
* Machine Learning model training and serving

#### 🌍 **Why It's Popular**:

* Easy notebook interface like Jupyter
* Abstracts complex Spark setups
* Great for collaborative work across teams (data engineers ↔ analysts ↔ scientists)

### 🔹 2. Databricks Platform Overview

Let’s understand each main component of the Databricks workspace:

| **Component** | **Purpose**                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workspace** | Your project area: stores notebooks, folders, and libraries         |
| **Clusters**  | Compute engines (Spark clusters) for executing notebooks            |
| **Notebooks** | Interactive coding environments for data exploration (like Jupyter) |
| **Jobs**      | Scheduled tasks (like batch ETL pipelines)                          |
| **Repos**     | Git-backed source control for notebooks and workflows               |
| **Data**      | Access to tables, file storage (DBFS), and Unity Catalog            |
| **SQL**       | Web-based SQL editor to run queries and create dashboards           |
| **MLflow**    | Built-in tracking of ML experiments and models                      |

### 🔹 3. Databricks Account Setup

You can start for free using the **Databricks Community Edition**.

#### 🚀 Steps to Get Started:

1. **Sign Up**: [https://community.cloud.databricks.com](https://community.cloud.databricks.com)

2. **Create Workspace**: After logging in, you'll land in your workspace.

3. **Launch Cluster**:

   * Go to **Clusters** → "Create Cluster"
   * Select minimal configuration (for CE, default options are fine)
   * Wait until it's in the `RUNNING` state

4. **Create Notebook**:

   * Go to **Workspace** → Create → Notebook
   * Choose language (Python recommended for starters)
   * Attach to your running cluster

### 🔹 4. Languages Supported in Databricks

| **Language**         | **Use Case**                           | **Common Usage**         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Python (PySpark)** | Most common, flexible                  | Data engineering, ML     |
| **SQL**              | Analysts and querying tables           | BI and dashboards        |
| **Scala**            | Native Spark language                  | High-performance compute |
| **R**                | Statistical analysis                   | Niche, data science use  |
| **Java**             | Supported but rarely used in notebooks | Backend integration      |

📘 Most learning and documentation will use **PySpark** and **SQL**, so prioritize those.
