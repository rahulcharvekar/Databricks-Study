## ✅ Stage 7: Machine Learning (Deep Dive)

---

### 🔹 1. What Makes Databricks ML-Friendly?

Databricks offers an end-to-end machine learning environment:

* Unified support for **exploration**, **feature engineering**, **training**, **tracking**, and **deployment**
* Built-in **MLflow**, an open-source platform for managing the ML lifecycle
* High scalability for large-scale ML training using **Spark**
* Collaboration with notebooks, version control, and scheduled jobs

---

### 🔹 2. MLflow Overview (Built into Databricks)

#### 🧠 What is MLflow?

MLflow helps you manage the **entire machine learning lifecycle**:

| Component         | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Tracking**      | Log experiments, metrics, parameters          |
| **Projects**      | Package ML code in a reproducible format      |
| **Models**        | Model registry, versioning, stage transitions |
| **Model Serving** | Deploy and expose REST endpoints              |

#### 🛠️ Tracking Example:

```python
import mlflow

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("max_depth", 5)
    mlflow.log_metric("rmse", 0.31)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

In the Databricks UI, navigate to:
**Machine Learning** → **Experiments** → View logged runs with parameters, metrics, and artifacts.

### 🔹 3. Machine Learning Workflow in Databricks

Here’s a typical pipeline:

#### 📊 1. **Data Preparation**

```python
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/silver_table")
pandas_df = df.toPandas()
```

#### 🧬 2. **Feature Engineering**

```python
pandas_df["log_sales"] = np.log1p(pandas_df["sales"])
```

#### 🤖 3. **Model Training**

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor(max_depth=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### ✅ 4. **Model Evaluation**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
```

#### 📦 5. **Log to MLflow**

```python
mlflow.log_param("model_type", "RandomForest")
mlflow.log_metric("rmse", rmse)
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

---

### 🔹 4. Model Registry & Staging

Databricks provides a **central registry** to:

* Register models
* Assign stages: Staging, Production, Archived
* Manage versions and rollback

#### 🌐 Deploy for REST Serving:

```python
mlflow.register_model("runs:/<run_id>/model", "SalesForecastModel")
```

In the UI:
**Machine Learning** → **Models** → Promote to **Production**
You can then **enable serving** and use the endpoint in your apps.

---

### 🔹 5. AutoML (No-Code Option)

Databricks also supports **AutoML**, which:

* Automatically generates baseline models
* Performs hyperparameter tuning
* Outputs notebooks you can customize

Steps:

1. Go to **Machine Learning** → AutoML
2. Select dataset and prediction column
3. Let AutoML generate model + notebook

---

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy:

> Think of MLflow as the **GitHub for ML models**: you track changes, versions, metrics, and promote your models to production — all while collaborating with your team.

---

### ✅ Summary Checklist for Stage 7:

* [ ] Understand MLflow tracking, registry, and serving
* [ ] Build and log experiments in MLflow
* [ ] Register and promote models using the Model Registry
* [ ] Try AutoML for quick prototyping
* [ ] (Optional) Serve a model using REST endpoint
